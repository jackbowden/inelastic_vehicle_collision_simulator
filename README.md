# inelastic_vehicle_collision_simulator
Single-file C++ program written for my University Physics instructor to prove understanding of inelastic collisions.
Takes the speeds of two vehicles, where they're located on a cartesian coordinate plane, and the amount of time before they crashed to determine where they end up if their crash was inelastic.
